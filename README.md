# 1: Movie Recommendation System (Week 1)
# Simple Movie Recommendation System

# Objective -

To perform data handling and exploratory data analysis on a movie dataset and build a basic recommendation system using similarity measures.

# Description -

This project uses a movie dataset (IMDb/TMDb) to analyze textual features and recommend movies based on content similarity or popularity. The focus in Week 1 is on data preprocessing, feature extraction, and understanding similarity-based recommendations.

# Key Tasks (Week 1)

Dataset loading and inspection
Handling missing and inconsistent data
Text preprocessing for movie descriptions
Exploratory analysis of genres, ratings, and popularity

# Techniques Used

TF-IDF Vectorization
Cosine Similarity
Basic content-based filtering

# Tech Stack

Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

# 2: House Price Prediction (Week 1)
# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Objective

To explore and preprocess housing data and perform exploratory data analysis as a foundation for regression-based price prediction.

# Description

This project analyzes a housing dataset (Boston Housing or similar) to understand feature relationships affecting house prices. Week 1 emphasizes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization before model training.

# Key Tasks (Week 1)

Data loading and structure analysis
Handling missing values and outliers
Feature scaling and encoding (if applicable)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Evaluation Focus (Later Stages)

RMSE
R² Score

# Tech Stack
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

# 📌 Note

Both projects in Week 1 focus exclusively on data handling and exploratory data analysis, forming the basis for modeling tasks in subsequent weeks.
